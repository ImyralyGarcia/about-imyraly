    <h1>About Imyraly</h1>
    <p>Hi y'all! My name is Imyraly a.k.a Milly! I am known as the creative one in my family. I enjoy working on DIY projects.
        DIY projects allow me to express myself through art and design.
        They also help me with stress management and they relax me. I like to makes gifts for friends and family
        for various celebrations throughout the year. People always come to me if they need help with design ideas.

        <p>I am a major animal lover. My love for them stems from a childhood of aiding injured animals with
            my grandfather. Farm animals are what I am more familiar with but my favorite animal is a dog.
            I love my boxer named Rylee, immensely. Some may say I am borderline obsessed with her dog but I'd like
            to think it's a strong love and adoration for my loyal companion.
